# 🌟 **Data Structures and Algorithms Practice**  

Welcome! 👋 This repository is my dedicated **learning and practice space** for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** while sharpening my **JavaScript programming skills**. Through this journey, I’m solving algorithmic challenges and strengthening my problem-solving skills to prepare for technical interviews and development tasks.  

## 🚀 **What's Inside**  

This repository is divided into several sections, each focusing on a fundamental area of DSA:  

### 🧮 **Mathematical Algorithms**  
Solve problems involving number theory, combinatorics, and computations like prime checking, factorials, and Fibonacci series.  

### 🔢 **Arrays**  
Master array operations such as searching, sorting, and merging. Arrays form the foundation of efficient data handling.  

### 🔗 **Linked Lists**  
Explore **Singly**, **Doubly**, and **Circular Linked Lists**, essential for understanding dynamic data structures.  

### 🌳 **Trees and Tries**  
Learn about **binary trees**, traversals, and **tries** for features like autocomplete and prefix searches.  

### 🎢 **Heaps and Queues**  
Grasp **Min-Heaps**, **Max-Heaps**, **Queues**, and **Deques**, ideal for priority-based tasks and sequential data handling.  

### 🎯 **Sorting Algorithms**  
Implement algorithms like Bubble, Merge, and Quick Sort to optimize and analyze problem-solving approaches.  

### 🌐 **Graphs**  
Dive into **DFS**, **BFS**, and their applications in networks, connectivity, and pathfinding problems.  

### 🛠️ **Hash Tables**  
Study hashing techniques for constant-time data storage and retrieval—critical for real-world efficiency.  

### 🌀 **Recursion**  
Break problems into smaller, identical sub-problems with recursion, an elegant problem-solving method.  

### 📜 **String Manipulation**  
Manipulate strings to reverse, find substrings, or solve pattern-matching challenges, vital for text-based operations.
